# AstroParty_Verilog-Game
This project was done for my first year ECE241 course. It was done in Verilog and it aimed to recreate a popular mobile game, AstroParty.

The game works by pitting two players against each other, each controlling a spaceship with the goal of the game being to shoot the other player. Inputs are done via a single ps2 keyboard, and output is seen on a vga display. First player to 3 eliminations wins.   

This project was done over the course of a month, where each week had a different milestone that we watned to hit.
